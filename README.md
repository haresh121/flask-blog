This is a small webpage built with python flask This is mainly a blog application where we can add,delete,modify and comment on the posts

Here in this application I've used many python modules: 
Some of them are Flask-Sqlalchemy, Flask-Bcrypt, Flask-Login, some javascript backing it up and for styling I used bootstrap
I added many features such as forgot password via email and sms otp and change the password in this the database used is oracle db

also specified some custom error routes for 404, 403 ,and for 500 some of the configurations are to be used in order 
to utilize the flask- mail

it has an in built todo app and has a inbuilt search which searches on the basis of the title of the post
